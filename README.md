## stocklit
(stock x [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)) is inspired by the [Bloomberg Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal) but aspire to be **open and free** with the goal of contributing to a bit more [information symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) in the market. If you are a stock investor or swing trader, this might be a useful tool for you and any [comments/ issues/ feedbacks](https://github.com/ohjho/stocklit/issues) are welcomed!

Under the hood, the stock data is powered by [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance). If you want something more real time (e.g. for day-trading purposes), you might want to checkout [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)

It's deployed using [streamlit share](https://www.streamlit.io/sharing): [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/ohjho/stocklit)
